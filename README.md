Each example comes with a documented Dockerfile that demonstrates best practices and provides a starting point for containerizing applications built with the corresponding language or framework. The examples cover production-like environments, and include instructions on how to build and run the containers.

## How to use an example Dockerfile?

To get started, simply navigate to the relevant directory for your chosen language or framework. Inside each directory, you will find a Dockerfile along with any additional files required for building the Docker image. Follow the instructions provided in the README file to build and run the containerized application.

Feel free to modify and adapt the examples to suit your specific requirements. Docker allows you to customize the containers based on your application's needs, such as installing additional dependencies, exposing specific ports, or setting environment variables.
